# Freshservice(or any other website) API Question Answering with RAG and LangGraph

This project demonstrates an end-to-end **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system for answering questions about the **Freshservice API documentation** using a **Large Language Model (LLM)** and **vector embeddings**. The system scrapes API docs, processes them into a vectorstore, and uses a LangGraph-based RAG pipeline to answer queries with relevant citations.

---

##  Project Overview

- **Scraping**: Fetches publicly accessible Freshservice API documentation sections.  
- **Vectorstore Ingestion**: Splits documentation into chunks, creates embeddings with OpenAI, and stores them in **Chroma**.  
- **RAG Pipeline**: Uses LangGraph to retrieve relevant docs and generate answers with an LLM.  
- **Output**: Returns answers, citations, and confidence scores.

##  Setup Instructions

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/freshservice-rag.git
cd freshservice-rag
---
## Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:
python -m venv myenv
source myenv/bin/activate      # Linux/Mac
myenv\Scripts\activate.bat     # Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
---
## Set up environment variables:
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key"   # Linux/Mac
setx OPENAI_API_KEY "your_openai_api_key"    # Windows
---
To scrape Freshservice API docs:
python scrape_freshservice.py
  Output: freshservice_docs.jsonl
  Contains url, heading, and text for each section.

Ingesting Docs into Chroma
python chunks_to_vectorstore.py
  Splits docs into chunks (chunk size 500, overlap 50).
  Generates embeddings using OpenAI (text-embedding-3-small).
  Stores in Chroma vectorstore with persistence.

Querying via RAG Pipeline
python RAG_freshservice.py
Output includes:
  Final Answer – response generated by the LLM.
  Citations – list of retrieved docs from vectorstore.
  Confidence – score from 0 to 1.
